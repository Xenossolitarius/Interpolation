# Interpolation
Implementation of Newtons Polynomal Formula in C/C++.
Implementation was done via linked-lists as a practice.
As a ploting library it was used KOOLPlot in some ancient CodeBlocks version which supported compilation.
Code was done for personal use and readability and code quality confirms it.
